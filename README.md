## Description
For my final homework assignment I was tasked with creating a Google book search application. This is a MERN application using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

With this app, users are able to search for a book of their choice. The search will then perform a get request using the Google Books API. Once the results have been rendered, the user can see the book title, authors, image and description. The user also has the capability of clicking the view icon which will then transport them to an external site to view more details. There is also a save button that saves the book into the database. Using Socket.io a notification pops up whenever a book is saved and can be viewed on multiple tabs with different routes. Implementing Socket.io was very challenging for me, but I am happy with the outcome.
